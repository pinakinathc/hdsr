This repository is an attempt to implement the paper "Handwritten Digit String Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network" by Hongjian Zhan, Shujing Lyu, Yue Lu.

The paper was published in 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2018.



=======================================================


To Execute this model:
Change the data path in `load_data.py` line 28
then: `python train_model.py`

========================================================

Dependencies:
* keras
* tensorflow
* pickle
* Opencv-python
* Numpy

you can choose any version of these packages.
I have tried to avoid functions which would be depreciated in near future.

If you are using this repository for experimental purpose, please note
I am NOT 100% sure that this is bug-free.
